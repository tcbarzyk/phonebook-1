This is the frontend of a phonebook web application built using React.

[Link to application](https://phonebook-part3-empty-pine-5489.fly.dev/)

[Backend repository](https://github.com/tcbarzyk/phonebook-backend)

Possible issue: It is possible to add the same name to the phonebook twice if the requests are made from different sources
